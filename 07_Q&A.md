### Does the jobs persists if the server is stopped?

By default the server runs on a local SQLite database, created at the first start. You can use your own database by providing a Sequelize configuration.

Migration commands are available to migrate your database manually. We strongly advise to specify a dedicated schema when using your own database to avoid any naming overlap or data loss.
