## Why graphql-node-jobs?

Use GNJ is you want a project that:

- Is simple yet powerful: The models, the API, the code... are kept simple
- Job persistance: Everything is stored in a database
- No-SaaS: Want to keep your data in your servers? Perfect, GNJ is just Javascript running on your stack
- Simple: Just a few thousands lines of code (but tested ones ðŸ˜„)
- Not a black box: Can be integrated easily in your Node.js codebase
- Use your ORM: GNJ uses Sequelize, so you stay in known territories
- Database Agnostic: Any database handled by Sequelize can be used

GNJ is kept small on purpose, the goal is to have the smallest API for the biggest impact.

## What does it do?

It allows you to setup many execution pipelines and run them.

## How it works

NGJ (graphql-node-jobs) is available as:

- A standalone NodeJS application
- A GraphQL schema plugable to your Apollo server Schema

---

## How can I integrate NGJ to my app?

---

### Prerequisites

To use GNJ, you need a project with:

- Apollo Server V4
- Express
- Sequelize
- [GraphQL-Sequelize-Generator](https://github.com/teamstarter/graphql-sequelize-generator)

A few modules need to be installed, like Graphql-tag, react, WebSocket, etc.

---

### Adding GraphQL-Node-Jobs to your project

```
yarn add graphql-node-jobs
```

To use the api, there is [node-graphql-jobs-react](https://github.com/vincentdesmares/node-jobs-react) that provide convenient Components to list/trigger/delete and other useful actions. It uses Websockets by default to provide a near-realtime experience.
